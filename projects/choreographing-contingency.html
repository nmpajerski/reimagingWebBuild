        Performance and architecture share a ceremonious history. Wrestling with architecture’s functionality and quantifying its performative attributes runs deep in the discipline. Likewise fabrication has long been considered a minor variable in the performance of architecture. The industrial fabrication of parts for assembly has often been considered as the last step of design and is commonly understood as a process for optimization. Consider the rationalization of surface panels on the Experience Music Project by Frank Gehry or the facade of the Phare tower by Morphosis — consider fabrication and get more for less! In this model, the act of fabrication has been seen as merely a means to an end.

        The following is a snapshot of research that sees a new role for fabrication in the discipline. It focuses on the act of performing the feat of fabrication. In the process, it examines the slippages of collaboration, performance’s medium specificity (the score), and a renewed interest in the site of production.
